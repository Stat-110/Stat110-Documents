Today we are going to explore data collected from 173 college students at UC Davis in two different statistics classes. One class was for students not in the liberal arts (n=148), while the other class was for students in the liberal arts (n=25). The data were collected in the Spring quarter of 2000. (Source: Utts and Heckard). We will be using graphical and numerical summaries in the software package PASW Statistics (formerly and commonly called SPSS). The instructions should work for either Windows or Mac with minor modification. Let me know if you see anythig confusing or get stuck at any point.

## Reading in the Data

First some preliminaries. we will read in the data, look it over, and make sure it is usable by SPSS.

1. Download the data from Moodle. Pay careful attention to where the file is saved!

2. Open SPSS Statistics. If you cancel the initial dialog box, you will see the Data Editor. This should look like an (empty) excel spreadsheet.

3. Bring in our data using `File` > `Open` > `Data` > `UCDavis.xlsx` (after changing `File Type` to `.xlsx`). Click OK to the dialog box so that SPSS uses its default choices for importing Excel data. Note that the spreadsheet has a Data View (where you can see the raw data), and a Variable View (where you can see properties of each variable in the data set).

4. In Variable View, we must make sure to define the Measure of each variable. `Scale` for a measurement/quantitative variable, `Nominal` for a categorical variable, and `Ordinal` if the categories have a natural order to them. For this data, the measures of all the variables are already correct.

5. After claning and defining your data, it can be saved as an SPSS data set for future use. Go to `File` > `Save As` and type in a filename (which will be given a `.sav` extension).

Now it's time to examine this data! In statistics, we always begin by visualizing our data using appropriate and insightful graphs. The best graph for a situation depends on the number of variables being examined (1 or 2 for now) and the type of variables (measurement/quantitative or categorical).
